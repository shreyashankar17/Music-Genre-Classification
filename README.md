# Music-Genre-Classification
 This project focuses on using machine learning to automatically classify music genres based on audio data. The dataset was preprocessed to extract essential features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) using the Librosa library. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was trained on the preprocessed data to predict the genre of a given audio clip. The project showcases the use of TensorFlow and Keras for model development, training, and evaluation. The repository houses the code, data, and resources related to the project.
Features:
Data Preprocessing: The audio data was processed using the Librosa library to extract Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which serve as critical features for our models.
Model Architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture was designed to capture intricate patterns within the MFCCs and enable accurate genre classification.
Training and Evaluation: The models were trained on a carefully split dataset, and their performance was evaluated on a separate testing set.
TensorFlow and Keras: The project demonstrates the use of TensorFlow and Keras, leading deep learning frameworks, to build, train, and evaluate models for genre classification.
Model Comparison: The repository includes code and visualizations for comparing the performance of different model architectures.
